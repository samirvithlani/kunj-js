void demo()
int sum()
float pers()

//JS --> function keyword --> arrow functions

event: somthing happen

DOM: document object model:
document --> window object explore

tag: 4 identifiers:id name class tag :- backend

js -->random number gen: bw 1 to 100
please guess number

50

20 --> guessed number is lowwe then gen
30 --> guessed number is high then gen
55 -> guessed number higher then gen
50 guess --> you have guessed number correctly in 5 attempts
